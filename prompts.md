## sample table

The table I will provide follows a structured format aimed at cataloging experimental samples for metabolomics studies. To ensure that any LLM (Large Language Model) can easily understand and interpret these tables, I'll outline their format and key components. 

#### **Source Name** :

* The **Source Name** indicates the biological origin or condition of the material. It could refer to organisms, controls, or blanks.
* **Source Name** stays constant across multiple samples derived from the same biological or experimental source.
* Examples: `control-1`, `blank_B-H12_E`, `QC_B-H10_E`, `#03_00_E`

#### **Sample Name** :

* The **Sample Name** refers to a specific experimental instance or biological replicate collected from the source.
* Each sample has a **unique identifier** in this column.
* Examples: `control-1`, `1dpi-1`, `#03_03_E`, `QC_1`

#### **Characteristics Columns** :

* **Characteristics[Organism]** : Specifies the organism involved (e.g.,  *Mus musculus* ), linked to a taxonomy reference such as  **NCBITAXON** .
* **Characteristics[Organism part]** : The tissue or part of the organism sampled (e.g.,  *spinal cord* ).
* **Characteristics[Variant]** : Represents specific variants of the organism, if applicable.
* **Characteristics[Sample type]** : Describes the sample type (e.g.,  **experimental sample** ,  **solvent blank** , etc.).

#### **Time Series Data** :

* Time points are represented in columns such as  **Factor Value[Cultivation time]** , indicating the time duration in units (e.g., days).
* Samples with different time points (e.g., `1 day`, `28 day`) should be treated as  **distinct groups** , not aggregated, since they represent different stages in the experimental timeline.
* Example groups: `1dpi` (1 day post-injury), `28dpi` (28 day post-injury), `day 3`, `day 5`.

#### **Experimental Conditions (e.g., Drug Concentrations)** :

* Besides time series, samples might be exposed to varying **experimental conditions** such as drug treatments, concentrations, or environmental factors. These conditions are typically listed in columns like **Factor Value[Condition X]** (e.g., drug concentration).
* For example, if samples have been treated with **Drug A at 10 mM** and  **Drug A at 20 mM** , they should be considered  **separate experimental groups** .
* Just like time series, conditions such as drug concentrations  **should not be aggregated** ; each level of the condition represents a distinct experimental group.
* Example groups: `10 mM Drug A`, `20 mM Drug A`.

#### **Ontology References** :

* Various characteristics are linked to standardized ontologies for clear definitions and to prevent ambiguity. Each characteristic may have a corresponding **Term Source REF** (referencing the ontology) and **Term Accession Number** (specific term identifier).
* Common ontologies include **NCBITAXON** for organisms, **BTO** for tissues, **CHEBI** for chemicals or solvents, and **CHMO** for experimental techniques.

#### **Protocol REF** :

* Refers to the protocol used for sample collection or processing, ensuring reproducibility of experimental conditions.

### Treatment of **Time Series Data** and **Other Experimental Conditions** as Independent Groups:

* **Time series data** : Samples collected at different time points (e.g., `day 1`, `day 28`) should be treated as  **independent groups** . Do not aggregate samples across time points; each time point represents a distinct experimental condition.
* **Drug concentrations or other continuous conditions** : Experimental groups where parameters such as **drug concentration** vary (e.g., **10 mM** and **20 mM** of a drug) must also be treated as separate, independent groups. Each concentration or condition level represents a unique state in the experiment and should not be aggregated with others.
* For example, samples with **10 mM Drug A** and **20 mM Drug A** represent distinct experimental conditions and should be analyzed separately.

### Distinction Between **Source Name** and  **Sample Name** :

* **Source Name** refers to the overarching biological entity or condition from which samples are derived, while **Sample Name** refers to individual instances or replicates of that source.
* **Source Name** typically remains consistent for samples derived from the same biological source or condition, whereas **Sample Name** uniquely identifies each experimental sample.
* For example, **Source Name** `control-1` might yield samples like `control-1`, `control-2`, etc., which are different replicates but share the same biological source.
